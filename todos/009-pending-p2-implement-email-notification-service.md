# Implement Email Notification Service

## Problem Statement
Create a Spring Boot email notification service to send emails for important bill events (OCR completion, bill approval). This service integrates with MailHog for local development and can be configured for production SMTP.

## Findings
- No automated notifications for bill processing events
- Users cannot be informed when OCR processing completes
- Approval workflow lacks communication mechanism
- System changes happen silently without user awareness
- Location: `backend/src/main/java/com/acme/billing/service/NotificationService.java` (to be created)

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Implement comprehensive email notification service
- **Pros**: Provides automatic communication for important business events
- **Cons**: Requires email template design and SMTP configuration
- **Effort**: Medium (3-4 hours)
- **Risk**: Low (Spring Mail is well-established)

## Recommended Action
[Leave blank - will be filled during approval]

## Technical Details
- **Affected Files**:
  - `backend/src/main/java/com/acme/billing/service/NotificationService.java`
  - `backend/src/main/java/com/acme/billing/config/EmailConfig.java`
  - `backend/src/main/resources/templates/email/` (HTML templates)
  - `backend/src/main/resources/application.yml` (Spring Mail config)
- **Related Components**: Event Handlers, MailHog, Domain Events
- **Database Changes**: No

## Notification Types:
- **OCR Completion**: Notify when bill file processing completes
- **Bill Approval**: Notify when bill is approved/rejected
- **Processing Errors**: Notify when OCR or processing fails
- **System Status**: Optional operational notifications

## Email Templates:
- **ocr-completion.html**: OCR processing success/failure notification
- **bill-approval.html**: Bill approval decision notification
- **base-template.html**: Common layout and styling

## Event Integration:
- **OcrCompletedEvent**: Trigger OCR completion email
- **BillApprovedEvent**: Trigger approval decision email
- **OcrFailedEvent**: Trigger error notification email

## Configuration Required:
```yaml
spring:
  mail:
    host: mailhog
    port: 1025
    username: ${SMTP_USERNAME:}
    password: ${SMTP_PASSWORD:}
    properties:
      mail.smtp.auth: false
      mail.smtp.starttls.enable: false

billing:
  notifications:
    enabled: true
    from-address: noreply@billing.local
    admin-email: admin@billing.local
```

## Dependencies Required:
- Spring Boot Mail Starter
- Thymeleaf Template Engine
- Event handling integration

## Resources
- Original finding: GitHub issue triage
- Related issues: #003 (BillAggregate events), #002 (MailHog in Docker)
- Spring Mail Documentation: https://spring.io/guides/gs/sending-email/
- Thymeleaf Documentation: https://www.thymeleaf.org/

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] NotificationService implemented with email sending capability
- [ ] HTML email templates created for OCR completion and bill approval
- [ ] Event handler integration for automatic email triggers
- [ ] MailHog integration for local development testing
- [ ] Configuration properties for SMTP settings
- [ ] Error handling for failed email delivery
- [ ] Dynamic content with bill information in templates
- [ ] Unit tests for email content and sending logic
- [ ] Integration tests with MailHog container
- [ ] Production SMTP configuration support
