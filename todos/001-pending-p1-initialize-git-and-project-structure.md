# Initialize Git Repository and Project Structure

## Problem Statement
The project currently only contains CLAUDE.md. Need to initialize proper Git repository and create the foundational project structure for both Spring Boot backend and FastAPI OCR service.

## Findings
- No version control in place
- No proper project structure for multi-service architecture
- Development cannot begin without foundation
- Location: `/home/tim/Documents/Billing/` (entire directory)

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Initialize Git and create Maven/Python project structure
- **Pros**: Establishes proper development foundation
- **Cons**: None - this is foundational work
- **Effort**: Small (1-2 hours)
- **Risk**: Low

## Recommended Action
[Leave blank - will be filled during approval]

## Technical Details
- **Affected Files**:
  - `.gitignore`
  - `backend/pom.xml`
  - `backend/src/main/java/com/acme/billing/` (package structure)
  - `ocr-service/app.py`
  - `ocr-service/requirements.txt`
- **Related Components**: Entire project foundation
- **Database Changes**: No

## Resources
- Original finding: GitHub issue triage
- Related issues: None

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore
- [ ] Spring Boot Maven project structure created
- [ ] FastAPI Python project structure created
- [ ] Package organization follows CLAUDE.md:71-84 conventions
- [ ] README.md created with basic project information
