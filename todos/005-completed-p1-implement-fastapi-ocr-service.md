# Implement FastAPI OCR Service with Tesseract - COMPLETED

## Problem Statement
Build FastAPI OCR microservice that uses Tesseract to extract text from PDF and image files. This service is critical for automated bill processing and must be lightweight and stateless.

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ Complete FastAPI OCR Service

**Files Created/Enhanced:**
- `ocr-service/app.py` - Complete FastAPI application with OCR capabilities
- `ocr-service/requirements.txt` - All Python dependencies specified
- `ocr-service/Dockerfile` - Production-ready container with optimization
- `ocr-service/test_app.py` - Comprehensive unit test suite
- `ocr-service/.env.example` - Environment configuration template
- `ocr-service/README.md` - Complete documentation
- `docker-compose.yml` - Updated with correct OCR service configuration

**Key Features Implemented:**

1. **Complete API Structure:**
   - `GET /` - Service information endpoint
   - `GET /health` - Health check with Tesseract availability verification
   - `POST /ocr` - Main OCR processing with structured data extraction
   - `GET /docs` - Auto-generated Swagger documentation
   - `GET /redoc` - Alternative API documentation

2. **Advanced OCR Processing:**
   - Multi-format support: JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, PDF files
   - Intelligent PDF processing with text extraction and OCR fallback
   - Comprehensive structured field extraction:
     - Total amounts with various formats and thousands separators
     - Multiple date formats (MM/DD/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, DD MMM YYYY, etc.)
     - Invoice numbers with common patterns
     - Vendor/company names with suffix detection
     - Bill/document titles

3. **Production-Ready Features:**
   - Pydantic models for request/response validation
   - Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
   - File size validation (configurable, 10MB default)
   - File type validation with strict MIME type checking
   - Async file processing for performance
   - Automatic temporary file cleanup
   - Environment-based configuration

4. **Optimized Docker Container:**
   - Multi-stage build with minimal layer size
   - Non-root user execution for security
   - Proper health check implementation
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Optimized system dependencies

5. **Comprehensive Testing:**
   - Unit tests covering all major functionality
   - Mock-based testing for OCR operations
   - Error handling and edge case validation
   - API endpoint testing
   - File validation testing

## Acceptance Criteria - All Met ✅

- [x] FastAPI service created with proper project structure
- [x] `/ocr` POST endpoint handles file uploads
- [x] Tesseract OCR integration for PDF, JPEG, PNG files
- [x] Structured response with extracted text and parsed fields
- [x] Error handling for unsupported formats and processing failures
- [x] Docker containerization with health checks
- [x] Request/response models with Pydantic validation
- [x] Requirements.txt with all dependencies
- [x] Basic unit tests for OCR functionality

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Response Structure (Exactly as Specified)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "extracted_text": "Full extracted text from document...",
  "parsed_fields": {
    "total": 123.45,
    "title": "INVOICE",
    "date": "01/15/2024",
    "invoice_number": "INV-2024-001",
    "vendor": "ACME Corporation"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "original_filename": "bill.jpg",
    "content_type": "image/jpeg",
    "file_size": 1024000,
    "file_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "processing_time_ms": 1250.5,

    "word_count": 156,
    "detected_lines": ["INVOICE #123", "Total: $100.00"]
  }
}
```

### Docker Compose Integration
- Corrected port mapping from mismatch (8000) to proper port (7070)
- Updated environment variables for proper configuration
- Fixed health check endpoints to match service port
- Ensured proper service dependencies

### Key Dependencies
- fastapi==0.115.4 - Web framework
- uvicorn[standard]==0.32.0 - ASGI server
- pytesseract==0.3.13 - Tesseract OCR integration
- PyMuPDF==1.25.1 - PDF processing
- Pillow==10.8.0 - Image processing
- pydantic==2.10.2 - Data validation

- ✅ OCR text extraction from images
- ✅ PDF text processing with OCR fallback
- ✅ Structured field extraction patterns
- ✅ API endpoint validation and responses
- ✅ Error handling for unsupported file types
- ✅ File size limit enforcement
- ✅ Health check functionality
- ✅ Tesseract availability checking

## Performance & Security Features

- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking file handling
- **Memory Efficiency**: Streaming file uploads
- **Security**: Non-root container, file validation, input sanitization
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, processing time tracking
- **Scalability**: Configurable limits and worker counts
